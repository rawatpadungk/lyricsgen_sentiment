# Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis on Lyrics and Lyrics Generation Using Markov Chain

- Note that, due to the large size of datasets we have, the preprocessed dataset cannot be uploaded onto the GitHub Repository. Hence, one alternative way to check the proprocessed data is to download all csv files from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albertsuarez/azlyrics, and then run each csv file through our ```proprocess.py``` file.

- You can run the ```composer.py``` to generate a lyric via this command:

```sh
python composer.py
```
